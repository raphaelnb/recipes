		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Combine chicken breasts and 1 cup chicken broth in a pot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, 
			reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Keep checking 
			that there is enough liquid in the pot and add more broth if necessary. Remove chicken from pot 
			allow to cool briefly, and shred with 2 forks.	
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, 
				about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, olives, and parsley. Stir well and season with 
				salt and pepper. Remove filling from heat and set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat 2 cups chicken broth and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; season 
				with salt and bring to a simmer. Add flour all at once and stir to form a thick paste. 
				Stir vigorously until mixture is smooth and no longer sticks to the bottom of the pan. 
				Remove from heat and let pastry cool.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once pastry is cool enough to handle, transfer to an oiled work surface and knead until 
				smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take a portion of pastry and roll into a golf ball-sized ball. Stick an oiled finger 
				into the center of the ball and press edges to create a small bowl. Stuff with 2 
				teaspoons chicken filling and gather top edges to seal, rolling into a teardrop shape. 
				Set croquette aside and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.
			</li>
			<li>
				Set out 3 bowls in the following order: flour, beaten eggs, bread crumbs. Roll each 
				croquette in flour, then dip in egg, then cover in breadcrumbs.
			</li>
